# TechVenture Website

TechVenture is a responsive website layout created with React. It features a navigation bar with routing and different sections for Home, Memes, News, Notes, and About Us.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of several components:

- `App.js`: Defines the main routing logic using `react-router-dom`.
- `Nav.js`: Navigation bar component with links to different sections.
- `Container.js`: Component for wrapping content and applying styles.
- `Home.js`, `Memes.js`, `News.js`, `Notes.js`, `About.js`: Individual section components.

## Routing

Routing is implemented using the `react-router-dom` library. Different sections of the website are represented by components, and navigation links use the `Link` component for seamless navigation.

```javascript
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Components/Home';
import Memes from './Components/Memes';
import News from './Components/News';
import Notes from './Components/Notes';
import About from './Components/About';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/Memes" element={<Memes />} />
      <Route path="/News" element={<News />} />
      <Route path="/Notes" element={<Notes />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

Navigation links in `Nav.js` use the `Link` component:

```javascript
// Nav.js
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import sty from './Nav.module.css';

export default function Nav() {
  return (
    <nav className={sty.par}>
      <h1 className={sty.Heading}> TechVenture</h1>
      <ul className={sty.Nav_Container}>
        <Link to="/">
          <li className={sty.Nav_items}>
            {/* ... */}
          </li>
        </Link>
        {/* ... other links ... */}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

## Responsive Design

The website layout is designed to be responsive using media queries. For example, the `side-section` in the `Home.js` component is hidden on screens with a width of 500 pixels or less.

```css
/* Home.css */
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  .side-section {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

This ensures a better user experience on smaller devices by adjusting the layout accordingly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm start`.
